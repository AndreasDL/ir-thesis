\section{The P300 speller}
%\subsection{The P300 speller explained}
The basic version of P300 speller uses a six by six grid of characters, each row and column is flashed in a random order while the subject silently counts the number of flashes of a certain character, as shown in figure \ref{P300SpellerPerson}. This procedure, where a train of stimuli with some infrequent occurring target stimuli is applied, is called the oddball paradigm. The technique triggers an increase in potential difference in the EEG around the parietal lobe. This Event Related Potential (ERP) occurs +- 300 milliseconds after the stimuli is flashed and is called the P300 waveform\cite{ComparisonClassifications}. The presence or absence of the P300 waveform is used by the P300 speller to determine what character the subject was focusing on, which allows the subject to spell text.

To improve the spelling time many improvements and research has been done. Language models were developed that predicted the word achieved great speedups\cite{LangModel}, classifiers were compared and tested on both healthy\cite{ClassTechniqueComp} and unhealthy subjects\cite{ComparisonClassifications}. Since many unhealthy subjects might have an impaired vision or eye movement, tactile\cite{TactileP300} and auditory\cite{AuditoryP300} spellers have been developed.

To improve accuracy, common problems such as adjacency distraction, when a subject is distracted from a neighboring flash, and double flashes, when the target row and column are flashed close after each othert, were avoided using new randomized paradigms\cite{PaperThibault}. Other input layouts like the T9 interface P300 speller have also been developed\cite{P300T9}.

To further speedup the spelling, Error potentials were explored\cite{ErrorPotentials}. Error potentials are triggered when the user becomes aware of en erroneous action, i.e. when a wrong character is selected. When an Error potential is detected, the character is usually changed to the second most probable character according to the P300 decoding\cite{ErrSecChar}, this is the most likely character.

\section{Benefits of creating an emotionally aware P300 speller}

Emotions play a major role in non-verbal communication, are quite complex and essential to understand human behavior. The ability to recognize emotions will improve the ability of computers to understand human interaction\cite{CompRecognizeEmotion} and thus improve the P300 speller's accuracy.

\subsection{Aid in Error potential detection}

To improve the detection of error potentials, emotion can be used. It is expected that when a person makes a lot of mistakes, his/her emotional state will change to a less happy, more frustrated state. Making the speller emotionally aware, could improve the detection of error potentials.

\subsection{Effect on the P300 wave}

Research with visual stimulus on healthy subjects, show that emotion has an effect on the auditory P300 wave\cite{AuditoryP300Effect}. Both the P300 peak amplitude and area was highest when viewing neutral pictures and descended further, in decreasing order, for sadness, anger and pleasure. The amplitudes were significantly lower at both Fz and C3 positions than Pz and Oz. The latency of the P300 ERP speller was shortest or neutrality and in increasing order longer for pleasure, anger and sadness. Interestingly, the P300 amplitudes were significantly larger for woman than for men. Additionally women showed lower amplitudes for for pleasure than neutrality or sadness while man showed smaller amplitudes for pleasure then either neutral or sadness. 

\subsection{Ethical issues}

Detecting emotion can also help in more ways than just improving spelling speed. Knowing what the subject feels, can help him communicate more humane while providing more insight for ethical issues, e.g. "How does the subject think about the P300 speller recording and analyzing his brain activity?".
