intro => behoudt zoveel mogelijk, want al goed gekeurd.
 -> bci 
 	--> EEG
 	--> wavebands
 	--> 10/20 system
 -> emotion 
 	--> valence arousal space
 	--> emotion in the brain & usedfeatures
 -> Possible applications for emotion recognition
 	--> P300 speller
 
 -> machine learning
 	--> general (what is, overfitting & bias/variance)
 	--> SVM
 	--> csp & lda
 	--> Random forests

 -> goal of thesis; finding relevant features for person specific recog & general pers recog both for valence and arousal

Methods
-> playing around ?
	--> svm => too complex
	--> csp & lda => overfitting by creating perfect weighted combinations

-> feature selection
	--> need for feature selection
	--> methods for feature selection & (dis)advantages
		pearson, mutual inf, distance correlation, 
		lr, l1, l2
		svm
		RF
		PCA ?

	--> advanced method from paper
		steps
		what you did differently
