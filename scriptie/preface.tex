This work was completed with the help of several people. I would like to thank these people. First of all my supervisors, prof. dr. ir. Joni Dambre and my counsellor ir. Thibault Verhoeven for their guidance and patience during the year. They gave me the freedom to steer the direction of my thesis, while still ensuring that the end result has scientific value.

Furthermore, I would like to thank my parents, stepparents, brothers and sister for giving me their support, not only this year, but throughout all my years as a student. I would also like to mention my mother and father for giving my the opportunity to study.
\npar
I would also like to thank my friends, among others, Cedric, Patrick, Michiel, Thomas and Wouter for supporting me during the year and creating an pleasant working atmosphere. 
\npar
Last but not least, I would also like to thank my thesis colleges, Nina, Bjorn and Thijs for giving me suggestions and ideas for my research.
