\section*{Summary}

An emerging field of research is the field of emotion recognition. Emotion can be observed in many ways, but the most reliable method is to use physiological signals.  This method uses machine learning to classify emotions based on characteristics or features extracted from the signals. To do so, good, reliable features are needed. This method compares a wide range of features and feature selection techniques to study the physiological responses triggered by emotion.
