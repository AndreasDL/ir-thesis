step 1: variable ranking: multiple rf for importances (average of 50 runs)

step 2: elimination: elimination of less importance variables

step 3: OOB errors averaged over 50 runs
	oob error for all k: 1 => all vars
	=> select smallest model with an oob error less than the minimal OOB error augmented by its imperial standard deviation
	=> lowers number of variables even more

Variable selection: sequential variable introduction
	only add variable when error gain exceeds certain threshold, the error decrease must be significantly lower than the std obtained by adding noisy variables
	=> add variables one by one and see if they exceed a certain error rate
