EEG data => dominance > 3 anders niet duidelijk genoeg!
delta, theta, alpha, beta en gamma band via bandpass
FFT per sec
log band energy
Linear dynamic system (LDS) features smooting
5 groups of features == 5 band
=> for each band one SVM with linear kernel
+ 6th svm with all features together

=>10 fold cross validation for each SVM

usage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) doesn't work always
=> use correlation coefficients between features and labels
go even further with manifold learning and reduce to only 1 dimension
